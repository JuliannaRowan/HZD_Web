        <p>
            Guerrilla B.V. (trade name: Guerrilla Games) is a Dutch 
            first-party video game developer based in Amsterdam and part of 
            PlayStation Studios. The company was founded as Lost Boys Games in 
            January 2000 through the merger of three
             smaller development studios as a subsidiary of
             multimedia conglomerate company Lost Boys.</p>

             <p>
             The developer soon began work on its two titles: Killzone (in development for Sony
              Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 2) and Shellshock: (in development 
              for Eidos Interactive for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Microsoft Windows).
              Both titles would be released the following year to mixed reception, however Killzone 
              enjoyed pre-release hype and anticipation, and despite some backfire effect due to the 
              media hype, Killzone went on to sell over a million copies worldwide, earning Greatest
               Hits and Platinum status in North America and Europe respectively.Guerrilla signed an 
               exclusive development agreement with Sony Computer Entertainment in March 2004, that 
               would see future development solely for Sony's line of video game consoles, the PlayStation
                2, PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 3.
