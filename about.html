                <p>
                   Horizon Zero Dawn takes place in a post-apoctolyptic world. You play as a female 
                   protagonist named "Aloy" as she adventures the world uncovering it's secrets and trying to 
                   find out where exactly these machines are coming from. As the game progresses Aloy's eagerness to
                   stop the machines from going rogue and destroying the new-born civilisation that is just beginning
                   to grow again. Aloy who began her life as an outcast of her tribe. Outcasted on the premise of having "no mother" is motivated
                   to find her own origins, to learn not only where the machines came from but where she came from.


                 <p>
                    The game mainly focuses on distanced combat as Aloy's main weapon is a bow. Her focus gives her the ability to
                    understand the weakness of her enemy and use her weapons accordingly (fire, electric, power arrows e.t.c).
                    The game can be played stealthily or very head on depending on the players preferences. Giving the player a choice
                    to decide how they want to uniquely go about every situation gives a feeling of freedom and encourages
                    strategising.
